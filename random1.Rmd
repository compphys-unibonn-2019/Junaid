## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
x = c(0)
y = c(0)
for (i in c(1:100)){
d = runif(1)
s = round(runif(1))
if(d <= .5 ) {
x = c(x,x[i]+(-1)^s)
y = c(y, y[i])
}
else
{
x = c(x,x[i])
y = c(y, y[i]+(-1)^s)
}

}
str(x)   #what does str(x) do when it is outside the loop?
str(y)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(x,y)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
